        <p>In Terms Of Future Work
            <br>
            🍎After graduation, I aim to work as a Software Developer, particularly in a company that develops technology for education. 
            I believe that learning is a key factor in improving people's lives. 
            Additionally, I plan to further my studies in Artificial Intelligence (AI) to enhance my expertise in developing programs that can learn and adapt in the future. 
            I hope that in the next five years, I will be able to develop applications that benefit education and society on a larger scale.

    <p>In the part of a semester.
        <br>
        I have studied many subjects that make me think about connecting various things, such as Statistics, C language, preliminary Web Applications and The coolest subject is Discrete math. 
        My path became more clear.
        <br>
        I'm also interested in Software development and AI Machine Learning but still can't decide on a future job. However, I would like to do some business in abroad. 
        It is expected that these things will not only in Thailand but the whole world will be aware of.
        <br>
        Then when I have more enough experience of my work. I will pass on knowledge to children.
