              It all started with orientation and freshman activities. I was
              very impressed because I got to meet so many people and formed
              great friendships. I realized that there were many people more
              skilled than I am, and it gave me motivation. When the term began,
              I started studying various subjects. The computer science-related
              courses I took included web design, introductory C programming,
              discrete math, and psychology for application design. These
              courses helped me learn many new things I had never known before

              I hope to become more proficient in programming and excel in new
              subjects such as data structures, algorithms, and others. I also
              hope that the numerous group projects I’ll encounter will go
              smoothly.

              because it’s the year before I graduate. Major projects and new
              subjects that I haven’t studied yet will help sharpen my knowledge
              significantly.

              It is a time to gain good experience and practice basic skills.
              Look for connections between things around you. Train yourself by
              encountering as many different problems as possible, and during
              this time, allow yourself to practice the content outside of the
